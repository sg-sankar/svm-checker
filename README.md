# 🧠 SVO/SVM Sentence Structure Checker

This Streamlit web app helps users check if their sentences follow the proper **Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)** or **Subject-Verb-Modifier (SVM)** structure. It provides intelligent NLP-based feedback to improve grammar, clarity, and even SEO-friendliness of your writing.

Inspired by [Matt Diggity’s SEO + ChatGPT Prompt Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNGyKZwMTaQ), this tool offers real-time, AI-powered grammar diagnostics with **syntax tree visualizations**, feedback on **passive voice**, **missing components**, **adverb placement**, and more.
